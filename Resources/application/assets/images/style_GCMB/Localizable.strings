And, all the while, you're never far from a cool cocktail bar or a caf serving up anything from a hearty Scottish breakfast to a refined dining experience. 

So, whether you want to find gifts for friends and loved ones, or simply restock your own wardrobe, follow local instinct. The style mile is the place to shop.";

"About - Part 2" = "Everyone knows that Glaswegians live, breathe, eat and sleep style. Little wonder that, in the very heart of the marvelous city they call home, one square mile houses the most extraordinary concentration of inspirational shopping, atmospheric cafs, fine restaurants, and decadent late night haunts.
